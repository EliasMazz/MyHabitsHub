/**
 * Base for MVI ViewModels: transforms user actions [INTENT]s into UI data [STATE] and one-time events [EVENT]s managed as part of the state.
 *
 * - UI sends [INTENT]s to `handleIntent()`
 * - Implement `onViewIntent()` to process [INTENT]s and call `updateState()` to modify state including [EVENT]s
 * - UI collects `state` (StateFlow) for screen data.
 * - UI collects `eventsFlow` (derived from state) for one time events and calls `consumeEvent()` after handling.
